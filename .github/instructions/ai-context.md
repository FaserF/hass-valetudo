# AI Context & Instructions for hass-valetudo

## 🧬 Project DNA
**Repository:** `hass-valetudo`
**Type:** Home Assistant Custom Integration
**Domain:** `valetudo`
**Description:** > [!IMPORTANT] > This is an **unofficial fork** of the official Home Assistant Valetudo integration. > Since the original repository often does not accept new Pull Requests, this fork was created to implement and maintain additional features for the community. This fork will be updated from the source branch, except the README.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Standards
- **Core Languages:** Python (Async/Await), Home Assistant Core API
- **Toolchain:** Standard
- **Dependencies:** None specified

## 📐 Coding Guidelines (Home Assistant Context)
- **Architecture:** Must adhere to modern Home Assistant architecture guidelines (`config_flow`, `coordinator`, `entity`).
- **Typing:** Strict typing is enforced. Use `mypy` annotations and avoid `Any`.
- **Asynchronous Patterns:** Operations must be non-blocking. Use `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for I/O operations. Do not use `requests` or blocking time sleeps.
- **Naming Conventions:** Follow PEP 8. Prefix internal variables appropriately. Use English for all logging and documentation.
- **Error Handling:** Use `UpdateFailed` for coordinator errors, and cleanly handle connection timeouts without logging sensitive credentials.

## 🤖 Tool-Specific Optimization

### 🐙 GitHub Copilot
- **Code Generation:** When generating entity definitions, ensure they inherit from standard HA classes (e.g., `CoordinatorEntity`). 
- **Boilerplate:** Match the existing structure of the file. Do not invent new configuration schemas if `cv.schema` or `voluptuous` are already imported.

### 🧠 Claude Code
- **Refactoring & Complex Tasks:** Before executing changes, review `__init__.py` and `manifest.json`. Map out the data flow from `config_flow` -> `Coordinator` -> `Entities`.
- **Validation:** Always verify imports and type safety. If proposing a fix for a state error, trace the variable back to the API response.

### 🚀 Google Antigravity
- **Codebase Navigation:** Begin by analyzing `custom_components/valetudo/`. Search for established patterns in `api.py` or `coordinator.py` before modifying entities.
- **Testing Requirements:** When modifying logic, run or propose tests matching the existing `tests/` directory structure. 

## 🧪 Test Procedures
- **Execution:** Use standard `pytest` framework.
- **Coverage:** Mock network requests using `aioresponses` or `pytest-httpx`. Never make live API calls in tests.

## 🚫 Exclusion Rules
- **NEVER MODIFY:**
  - `translations/` (unless specifically asked to add a new string)
  - `hacs.json` (managed via CI/CD or strictly manually)
  - `.github/workflows/` (CI pipelines are considered stable)
